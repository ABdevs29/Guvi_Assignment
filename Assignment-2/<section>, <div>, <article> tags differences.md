#Differences between section, div and article tags
  
section | div | article
--------- | ----- | ---------
section element represents a generic section of a document or application | div element has no special meaning at all | | article element represents a independent item section of content
It is a thematic grouping of content. Ex: Chapters, Tabbed pages, numbered sections of a thesis | It can be used with the class, lang, and title attributes to mark up semantics common to a group of consecutive elements | It is an independent item section of content. Ex: forum post, magazine and newspaper article
The section element is not a generic container element. The section element is appropriate only if the contents would be listed explicitly in the documentâ€™s outline. It typically has a heading | When no other element is suitable, the div element is used as an element of last resort. Otherwise, it leads to poor accessibility for reader | Content in the article element should be independently distributable or reusable
